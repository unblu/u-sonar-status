== Endpoints

The tool needs to be contacted from both SonarQube and GitLab.

=== Sonar endpoints

[#sonar-non-blocking]
==== Sonar main endpoint

[source, http]
----
POST <server url>/u-sonar-status/sonar
----

This is the principal endpoint that receives a https://docs.sonarqube.org/9.6/project-administration/webhooks/[Webhook event] sent by SonarQube.

Requests are processed asynchronously, meaning that SonarQube will receive a `202 Accepted` response back immediately.

Example:

[source, json]
----
include::sonar-non-blocking-response.json[]
----

* `build_commit` and `build_timestamp` allow you to identify the `u-sonar-status` version.
* `sonar_event_uuid` is a value used to identify the request.

[#sonar-blocking]
==== Sonar blocking endpoint

A secondary endpoint where the process in done in a blocking way is available as well:

[source, http]
----
POST <server url>/u-sonar-status/sonar-blocking
----

With this blocking endpoint you get more information about the created comment in the returned response.

Example:

[source, json]
----
include::sonar-blocking-response.json[]
----

Using this endpoint might be interesting for debugging purposes, since you see the response containing the details of the action.

[#sonar-replay]
==== Sonar replay endpoint

An additional endpoint is available to trigger the process using some simplified input compared to the event sent by the Sonar Webhook mechanism.

[source, http]
----
POST <server url>/u-sonar-status/sonar-replay
----

Body:

[source, json]
----
include::sonar-replay.json[]
----

The response is the same as in the blocking case.

Using this endpoint is interesting to trigger again the `u-sonar-status` action for a given event using `curl`, without having to send the complete webhook event body.

=== GitLab endpoints

[#gitlab-non-blocking]
==== GitLab main endpoint

[source, http]
----
POST <server url>/u-gitlab-status/gitlab
----

This is to receive the external check payload (see https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/status_checks.html#example-payload-sent-to-external-service[Example payload sent to external service]) sent by GitLab.

Requests are processed asynchronously, meaning that GitLab will receive a `202 Accepted` response back immediately.

Example:

[source, json]
----
include::gitlab-non-blocking-response.json[]
----

* `build_commit` and `build_timestamp` allow you to identify the `u-gitlab-status` version.
* `gitlab_event_uuid` is a value used to identify the request.

[#gitlab-blocking]
==== GitLab blocking endpoint

A secondary endpoint where the process in done in a blocking way is available as well:

[source, http]
----
POST <server url>/u-gitlab-status/gitlab-blocking
----

With this blocking endpoint you get more information about the created comment in the returned response.

Example:

[source, json]
----
include::gitlab-blocking-response.json[]
----

Using this endpoint might be interesting for debugging purposes, since you see the response containing the details of the action.

[#gitlab-replay]
==== GitLab replay endpoint

An additional endpoint is available to trigger the process using some simplified input compared to the event sent by the GitLab Webhook mechanism.

[source, http]
----
POST <server url>/u-gitlab-status/gitlab-replay
----

Body:

[source, json]
----
include::gitlab-replay.json[]
----

The response is the same as in the blocking case.

Using this endpoint is interesting to trigger again the `u-gitlab-status` action for a given event using `curl`, without having to send the complete webhook event body.

=== Readiness and liveness probes

The application provides standard probes:

* `<server url>/q/health/live`: The application is up and running (liveness).
* `<server url>/q/health/ready`: The application is ready to serve requests (readiness).
* `<server url>/q/health`: Accumulating all health check procedures in the application.

=== Info endpoint

The application provides some information about the current version:

* `<server url>/q/info`

This can be turned off with the quarkus configuration property `quarkus.info.enabled` set to `false`.
