=== Retry button is not working in GitLab

When an on prem sonar server is user (instead of sonarcloud.io), the endpoint `api/project_pull_requests/list` that is queried does not contains the commit information.

In the u-sonar-satus tool you will see following log entry:

----
Skipping event because head of merge request '100' in project '56' is 'ba22a8ce46acee878adec5ffee5a5621c9d35ac1' and does not match the revision in Sonar 'null'
